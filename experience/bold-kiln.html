          If a person wants to go on a holiday trip then he/she has a lot of
          questions like shall I buy a holiday package online or from the local
          operator? What things and places should I explore on the trip and
          under budget? I want to alter my itineraries etc. To tackle this
          problem Tripshire plans to create a platform in which the user can
          explore and book itineraries that can only be put together by an
          insider or a travel consultant, share their travel experience by
          writing on the platform, users can also customize their itineraries.

          I joined as a backend developer. My responsibility was to design the
          nodejs API for the blog, booking, payment, trips and authentication
          functionality. I also created Reactjs components for the admin panel
          through which admin can add and update trips.
